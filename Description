 Heart Disease Prediction using SVM â€“ Key Points
Model Used: Support Vector Machine (SVM) for binary classification (0 = No Heart Disease, 1 = Heart Disease).

Accuracy:

Achieved an overall accuracy of 87% (i.e., 53 out of 61 predictions were correct).

Class-wise Performance:

Class 0 (No Heart Disease):

Precision: 0.86

Recall: 0.86

F1-score: 0.86

Class 1 (Heart Disease):

Precision: 0.88

Recall: 0.88

F1-score: 0.88

Average Scores:

Macro Average (unweighted mean): All metrics = 0.87

Weighted Average (based on support): All metrics = 0.87

Support:

Class 0: 29 samples

Class 1: 32 samples

Model Performance Summary:

Balanced performance across both classes.

High recall and precision for detecting heart disease.

No indication of class imbalance or overfitting.
